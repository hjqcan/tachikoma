AI Agent Architectures
1. Introduction
→ AI agents are autonomous systems designed to perceive their environment, reason about it, and take actions to achieve specific goals.
→ The architecture defines how these agents sense, think, and act.
2. Core Components of an AI Agent
→ Perception Module → collects data from the environment through sensors or APIs.
→ Knowledge Base → stores learned facts, rules, and representations.
→ Reasoning Engine → interprets data, makes decisions, and predicts outcomes.
→ Action Module → executes decisions or communicates with external systems.
→ Learning Module → updates the agent’s knowledge through feedback or new experiences.
3. Types of AI Agent Architectures
a) Reactive Architectures
→ Based on direct stimulus-response mechanisms.
→ No internal memory or model of the world.
→ Fast and efficient but limited in reasoning capability.
→ Example → Behavior-based robotics or simple chatbots.
b) Deliberative Architectures
→ Build and maintain an internal model of the environment.
→ Use symbolic reasoning and planning.
→ Example → Knowledge-driven expert systems.
c) Hybrid Architectures
→ Combine reactive speed with deliberative reasoning.
→ Use layered structures → reactive at the bottom, deliberative at the top.
→ Example → Autonomous vehicles or intelligent assistants.
d) Learning Architectures
→ Use machine learning to adapt behaviors.
→ Capable of improving over time with new data.
→ Example → Reinforcement learning agents in gaming or trading.
4. Common Models in AI Agent Design
→ BDI Model (Belief-Desire-Intention) → simulates human-like reasoning with goals and plans.
→ Layered Model → separates perception, reasoning, and action into distinct layers.
→ Blackboard Architecture → multiple components share knowledge through a common data space.
→ Subsumption Architecture → higher layers control or suppress lower-level actions for priority management.
5. Communication and Coordination
→ Agents often interact in multi-agent systems (MAS).
→ They use protocols to cooperate, compete, or negotiate.
→ Example → Distributed AI in swarm robotics and smart grids.
6. Key Design Considerations
→ Scalability → how the agent performs under large workloads.
→ Robustness → ability to handle unexpected input.
→ Adaptability → learning and modifying strategies dynamically.
→ Transparency → explainable reasoning for trust and accountability.
7. Real-World Applications
→ Intelligent personal assistants → Alexa, Siri, Google Assistant.
→ Autonomous systems → drones, self-driving cars.
→ Financial trading bots → adaptive decision-making systems.
→ Smart healthcare → AI agents for diagnosis and treatment recommendations.
8. Future Directions
→ Integration with Large Language Models (LLMs) for reasoning and communication.
→ Multi-agent collaboration for complex environments.
→ Ethical frameworks for responsible decision-making.
→ Edge-deployed agents for real-time intelligence.
